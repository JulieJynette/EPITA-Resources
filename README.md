# EPITA-Resources

This is the database for materials during my study (2022.03-2023.09) in EPITA in major:Artificial Intelligence for Marketing Strategy. It includes slides (majority), works (in-class and off-class), final projects/evaluations and also timetable for the whole year, etc. 

Please use these works just as an example, don't copy it directly because this is not good for your study.

There are three semesters in total (for the 2022 fall intake, there are four semesters). Courses in both campuses (EPITA and EM Normandie) are not the same as shown on the syllabus.
If you have any questions about the course or the codes, please contact me at the following email:
juliejynettejoseph@gmail.com

There must be some mistakes or errors in the codes, if you can improve them and send me the improved ones, I'd really appreciate it!


# All materials are updating gradually...
